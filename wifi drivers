Wifi network drivers are not appearing after I reset a device for a staff member. (this example is for devices running win10+ )

Found the issue was a driver issue, after trying to reinstall windows again I got the same issue. 

this is the fix: in this example the laptop is a HP Elitebook 840 G8 and the usb is D: drive (change the relivent information to fit your issue)

On another computer and download all of the relivent network drivers.

I created a .bat file named 'netdrive.bat' the reason for creating the file was to make the download of the drivers automated, basically makes life easier to write commands once 

shift+F10 brings up cmd -
If keyboard isnt working and an external keyboard isnt working you have to plug in the keyboard and hold the power button for 1 second. The screen should turn off to turn it back on spam the space key on the external keyboard.

typing diskpart | then list volume -
this will show you all of the different drives that you have in your computer the usb that you have the drivers or .bat file on will be a removable drive

type exit -
this will go back to system32 user so you can install the drivers.

if the driver is encypted by bitlocker use the command below, the reason I mention this is because at our work we use bitlocker encyption.
Manage-bde -unlock D: -password -
after you type in this command you will be prompted to type in the password, after this the driver will be unlocked and now you can access the dater on the drive.

now that you are able to use the usb use the command below to run the bat file.
start D:\scripts\netdrive.bat - 
the start command will start the script, alternitively you can run each driver individually with the start command, just locate the driver and run it example is below:
start D:\drivers\network\sp142400.exe

after all drivers have been sucessfully installed restart the computer, you can use the command below to restart the computer:
shutdown -p

after restart issue should be fixed.
